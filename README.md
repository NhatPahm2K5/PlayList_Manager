# 🎶 HarmonyHub - Playlist Manager 🎶 is a collaborative project developed by students of the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course, University of Transport and Communications (UTH). This project demonstrates the power of the Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL) in managing music playlists efficiently—allowing seamless navigation (next/previous song) and easy looping of the entire list—while utilizing a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store the main music library and facilitate quick searches by song title or artist. It offers a seamless user experience for music lovers and developers alike.
